Asg 3: Heapsort and Insertion Sort
**********************************

insertionSort.c
Defines the insertionSort method specified in insertionSort.h

insertionSort.h
The header file for the insertionSort method defined in insertionSort.c

heapSort.c
Defines the heapSort method specified in heapSort.h

heapSort.h
The header file for the heapSort method defined in heapSort.c

heap.c
The heap ADT which defines all the methods for heap construction
and manipulation which are specified in heap.h

heap.h
The header file which specifies the methods for the heap ADT whose
methods are defined in heap.c

heapDriver.c
The code for the program that tests the functions of the heap ADT.

sortPrint.c
Code for the program which tests the heapSort and insertionSort methods,
prints the results of each, and verifies that both sorts were correct.

sortComp.c
Code for the program which runs the heapSort and insertionSort methods
on two separate arrays of the same data, measures the speed of each sorting
method, and prints information about the speed of each.

Makefile
Compiles the code and creates the three programs
sortComp, sortPrint, heapDriver
